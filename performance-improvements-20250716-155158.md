# Performance Improvement Suggestions
Generated: Wed 16 Jul 2025 15:51:58 ACST

## General Optimizations

### 1. Batch Operations
- Combine multiple Homebrew installations into single commands
- Use parallel downloads where possible
- Batch file operations instead of individual commands

### 2. Caching Strategies
- Cache command existence checks
- Store frequently accessed values in variables
- Use temporary files for intermediate results

### 3. Network Optimizations
- Add timeouts to all network operations
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Use shallow git clones where possible
- Parallel downloads for multiple files

### 4. File System Optimizations
- Use bulk file operations instead of loops
- Avoid unnecessary file existence checks
- Use efficient text processing tools

## Specific Script Optimizations

### install-homebrew.zsh
Homebrew installation and configuration

- Batch brew install commands: `brew install pkg1 pkg2 pkg3`
- Add curl timeouts: `curl --max-time 30 --retry 3`

### setup-dotfiles.zsh
Dotfiles setup and chezmoi operations

- Batch brew install commands: `brew install pkg1 pkg2 pkg3`

### install-packages.zsh
Package installation and validation

- Batch brew install commands: `brew install pkg1 pkg2 pkg3`

### system-maintenance.zsh
System maintenance and updates

- Batch brew install commands: `brew install pkg1 pkg2 pkg3`

## Implementation Examples

### Optimized Homebrew Installation
```bash
# Instead of:
# brew install git
# brew install node
# brew install python

# Use:
brew install git node python
```

### Parallel Downloads
```bash
# Instead of sequential downloads:
# curl -O url1
# curl -O url2

# Use parallel downloads:
curl -O url1 & curl -O url2 & wait
```

### Cached Command Checks
```bash
# Cache command existence
declare -A COMMAND_CACHE

command_exists() {
    local cmd="$1"
    if [[ -z "${COMMAND_CACHE[$cmd]:-}" ]]; then
        if command -v "$cmd" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            COMMAND_CACHE[$cmd]="true"
        else
            COMMAND_CACHE[$cmd]="false"
        fi
    fi
    [[ "${COMMAND_CACHE[$cmd]}" == "true" ]]
}
```

## Monitoring and Measurement

### Performance Monitoring
- Use `time` command to measure script execution
- Monitor memory usage with `ps` or `top`
- Profile network operations with `netstat`
- Use `dtrace` or `instruments` for detailed analysis

### Benchmarking
```bash
# Time script execution
time ./scripts/setup.zsh --dry-run

# Memory usage monitoring
/usr/bin/time -l ./scripts/setup.zsh --dry-run
```
