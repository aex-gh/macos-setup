12. **backup-restore.zsh**: 619 → 296 lines (52% reduction)
13. **run-tests.zsh**: 544 → 251 lines (54% reduction)

### 📊 Key Statistics:
- **Scripts optimised**: 13
- **Total lines reduced**: 3,354 lines
- **Average reduction**: 52%
- **Common library created**: `scripts/lib/common.zsh`

### 🎯 Key Achievements:
- ✅ Created comprehensive common library with shared functions
- ✅ Eliminated massive code duplication (125+ duplicate logging functions)
- ✅ Modernized validation with built-in tools (`brew bundle check`)
- ✅ Streamlined installation automation
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging consistency
- ✅ Enhanced device detection consistency
- ✅ Consolidated directory creation patterns
- ✅ Standardized script structure across all optimized scripts

### 🔧 Common Library Features:
- Shared logging functions (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `success`, `debug`, `header`)
- Device detection helpers (`detect_device_type`, `is_macbook_pro`, `is_mac_studio`, etc.)
- Validation utilities (`check_macos`, `check_homebrew`, `command_exists`)
- Progress tracking system with visual progress bars
- Cleanup and resource management
- Directory creation helpers with proper permissions
- Brewfile path management (`get_brewfile_path`, `get_common_brewfile_path`)
- macOS integration helpers (`notify`, `get_default`, `set_default`)

## Success Criteria for Remaining Tasks
